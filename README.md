The new version of droneshare - built upon DroneAPI

(For the time being mostly just the AngularFun template)

## Developers guide

This application is built using AngularFS and coffeescript.

Coffeescript is like javascript but with much less boilerplate code.  It compiles down to javascript (trivially).  If you've never used coffeescript,
please see this [http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/](five page user guide).  If you _still_ prefer javascript: We've got ya covered.  
Simply run the following grunt task.

`grunt jslove` - will transpile all of the CoffeeScript files to JavaScript and throw out the Coffee.


## A note on tabs, spaces and line-endings

This project uses a [http://editorconfig.org/](.editorconfig) file to specify source formatting conventions.  We encourage you to install a suitable
plug-in into your text-editor of choice.
